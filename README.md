# COVID19
This repo includes R code related to sourcing the JHU COVID19 data and building associated shiny apps. 

US county and health region shapefiles are needed to run much of this. Health region shapefiles are available in my shapefiles repo. 

I have also included a slides from a presentation from the virutal Fields Institute's conference on "Advancing knowledge about spatial modeling, infectious diseases, environment and health." http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/activities/19-20/modeling-infectious-diseases
